## Work done

* Finished inference.py !!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
  * Redid process_image to just resize and not do normalization. Apperently the description on model hub was wrong and the only preprocessing that needed to be done was to resize the image.
  * Added 2 functions, `find_label` and `get_bird_name`.
* Updated the README.md a bit with some new tasks
* Aaron decided to join in on the project. He is going to try and create an Android app for the project
* Added the labelmap csv into the repo.
* Reorganized the Logs to have seperate directories for Aarons logs and mine.
