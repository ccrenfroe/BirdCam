## Work done

* Added camera.py
  * This will handle all of the functionality of the camera.
  * Currently just takes a picture and saves it to `PicturesIn`.
  * May extend this to be a class to modify camera states, such as the zoom and flipping the image, maybe resizing it, etc.
* Packaged all of the scripts together into `birdcam`.

## Time

1 and a half maybe? Got lost again :)

## Next task

Finish motion_detector.py to work optimally.
