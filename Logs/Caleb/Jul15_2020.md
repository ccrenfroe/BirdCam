## Work done

* Finished image_preprocessing
  * added process_directory to process a directory full of images.
  * readded process_image to process a single image
* Starting to implement inference.py
  * Following [this](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/running-tensorflow-lite-image-classification-models-in-python-92ef44b4cd47) example/guide
  * Copied process_image function over as well as its imports
* Made a stack overflow post <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62922591/how-to-input-file-into-tflite-model-for-inference-valueerror-cannot-set-tensor>
  * Having trouble running the inference on an image. For some reason, it wants input as uint8, even though the description for the input on tensorflow hub does not mention this in the input requirements.
