## Work done

* Deleted image_preprocess.py
  * This was deprecated and wasn't necessary to keep anymore.
* Started to do docstring style commenting.
  * Recommented inference.py with docstrings.
* Added file_handler.py
  * This script will handle all of the work of organizing the directory structure and moving images around.
  * Wrote skeleton functions for new_image and move_image.
  * Implemented move_image.

## Time

2hrs maybe? Got lost in time.

## Next task

Start working on a camera.py script to take a picture with the arducam on the py. Try and automate this process if possible, by testing it out with the motion detector.
Will most likely turn into research on better motion detection.
